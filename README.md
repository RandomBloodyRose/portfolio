As an aspiring storyteller, I have a deep appreciation for life's experiences and a curiosity that drives me to explore the world. I find inspiration in everything, and my love for traveling and creating is rooted in my desire to bring characters to life in vivid and unique worlds of my own making.
One of my most treasured memories is from when I visited Central Europe for the first time while finishing my AA. As I sat and people-watched while drawing in my sketchbook, I couldn't help but notice the subtle nuances of personalities in how people carried themselves, from the way they walked to the manner in which they sipped their coffee. It was a fascinating moment that further fueled my desire to bring characters to life in compelling and authentic ways.

I believe that my passion for storytelling, combined with my love of exploration, creativity, and keen observational skills, make me an excellent candidate for any task that involves bringing new worlds to life. I look forward to the opportunity to utilize my skills and collaborate with others in bringing new ideas to fruition.
